  - Green (Happy) - Connected to pin 3
  - Blue (Sad) - Connected to pin 5
  - Yellow (Thinking) - Connected to pin 6
  - Red (Angry) - Connected to pin 9
  - White (Status) - Connected to pin 11
- Resistors (220Î©) for each LED
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- USB cable to connect Arduino to computer

## Software Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Arduino IDE
- Required Python packages (install with `pip install`):
  - pyserial
  - pyttsx3
  - SpeechRecognition
  - pywhatkit
  - requests
  - PyAudio

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   python install_dependencies.py
   ```

2. **Connect the Arduino**
   - Wire the LEDs according to the pin assignments
   - Connect Arduino to your computer via USB

3. **Upload Arduino Code**
   - Open `arduino_led_expressions.ino` in Arduino IDE
   - Select your board and port
   - Upload the code

4. **Test the Hardware**
   ```bash
   python test_led_expressions.py
   ```

5. **Test Audio System**
   ```bash
   python test_mac_audio.py
   ```

6. **Select a Female Voice (Similar to Siri)**
   ```bash
   python select_voice.py
   ```
   This tool lets you choose and test different female voices for Jarvis.
   
7. **Run Jarvis**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

7. **Speak commands starting with "Jarvis"**
   - "Jarvis, what time is it?"
   - "Jarvis, what's the weather today?"
   - "Jarvis, tell me a joke"
   - "Jarvis, play some music"

## Troubleshooting

- **Microphone not working?**
  - Check system permissions for your Terminal or VS Code
  - Try running with elevated permissions
  
- **Arduino not connecting?**
  - Check the port in the code
  - Try unplugging and reconnecting
  - Verify the correct code is uploaded

- **Voice commands not recognized?**
  - Speak clearly and directly to the microphone
  - Try in a quieter environment
  - Check internet connection for speech recognition
